This program is a class assigment I had to complete as a final project. The program is essentially a store where you can input the books/audiobooks and dvds and the user can choose what to buy. It then adds the prices of everything the customer chose then removes those items from the shopping cart.

Please run the program from FinalOnlineStore.java since this is the main class.
